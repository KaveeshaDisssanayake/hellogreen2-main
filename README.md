 Hello Green web app for global non-biodegradable waste collection.
🌿🌿 Introducing HelloGreen : 🌿🌿

As the vibrant minds behind the capstone project for our 2nd year, 2nd semester in the Department of Computing at the Faculty of Computing, we're thrilled to unveil HelloGreen !

Under the expert guidance from Mrs. Ashansa Wijerathne from Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, we've crafted the Hello Green Project for solid waste management around the world.

"Hello Green" is an innovative web platform dedicated to addressing the pressing issue of non-biodegradable waste management.

Dur platform serves as a digital marketplace that enables individuals and businesses to buy and sell various types of non-biodegradable waste materials, with a strong focus on sustainability and responsible waste disposal.
