            <div className=" text-start flex flex-col gap-5">
                <p className=" text-xl font-semibold">Introduction:</p>
                <p>Polythene, a type of plastic commonly used in packaging and everyday products, has become synonymous with convenience in our modern lives. However, the widespread use and improper disposal of polythene have contributed to a growing environmental crisis. Polythene pollution poses significant threats to ecosystems, wildlife, and human health, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable waste management solutions. In this article, we explore the impact of polythene pollution and discuss strategies for its effective management.</p>

                <p className=" text-xl font-semibold">Understanding Polythene Pollution:</p>
                <p>Polythene pollution refers to the accumulation of polyethylene-based plastic waste in the environment, including landfills, water bodies, and natural habitats. Polythene is non-biodegradable, meaning it persists in the environment for hundreds of years, leading to long-term pollution and ecological damage. Improper disposal practices, such as littering and illegal dumping, exacerbate the problem, resulting in visual pollution and environmental degradation.</p>

            <div className=" text-start flex flex-col gap-5">
                <p className=" text-xl font-semibold">Impact on the Environment and Health:</p>
                <p>Polythene pollution has far-reaching consequences for the environment, ecosystems, and human health. Wildlife, particularly marine animals and birds, are susceptible to ingestion or entanglement in polythene debris, leading to injury, suffocation, and death. Additionally, microplastics derived from degraded polythene can contaminate soil, water sources, and food chains, posing risks to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, exposure to polythene pollutants and associated chemicals has been linked to adverse health effects in humans, including respiratory problems, hormonal disruptions, and reproductive disorders.</p>
